  <p><span>Ann watched a TV program about health and learned that it is recommended to sleep at least </span><span class="MathJax"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mi">A</span></span><span></span></span></span><span></span></span><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML">A</span></span><span> hours per day, but oversleeping is also not healthy, and you should not sleep more than </span><span class="MathJax"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mi">B</span></span><span></span></span></span><span></span></span><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML">B</span></span><span> hours. Now Ann sleeps </span><span class="MathJax"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mi">H<span></span></span></span><span></span></span></span><span></span></span><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML">H</span></span><span> hours per day. If Ann's sleep schedule complies with the requirements of that TV program – print "Normal". If Ann sleeps less than </span><span class="MathJax"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mi">A</span></span><span></span></span></span><span></span></span><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML">A</span></span><span> hours, output “Deficiency”, and if she sleeps more than </span><span class="MathJax"><span class="math"><span><span><span class="mrow"><span class="mi">B</span></span><span></span></span></span><span></span></span><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML">B</span></span><span> hours, output “Excess”.</span><br></p> 
  <p>Input to this program are the three strings with variables in the following order: <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\( B \)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\( H \)</span>. <span class="math-tex">\( A \)</span> is always less than or equal to <span class="math-tex">\( B \)</span>.</p> 
  <p>Please note the letters' cases: the output should exactly correspond to what required in the problem, i.e. if the program must output "Excess", output such as "excess", "EXCESS", or "ExCeSs" will not be graded as correct.</p> 
  <p>You should <b>carefully</b> think about all the conditions, which you need to use. Special attention should be paid to the strictness of the used conditional operators: distinguish between <span class="math-tex">\( \lt \)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\( \le \)</span>; <span class="math-tex">\( \gt \)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\( \ge \)</span>. In order to understand which ones to use, please <b>carefully</b> read the problem statement.</p>
