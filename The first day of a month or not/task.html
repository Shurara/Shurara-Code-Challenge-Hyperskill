  <p>We are used to talking about days in&nbsp;relation&nbsp;to their position in a month, for example, February 22. But as we've already mentioned, there's another way to address a day: to give an order number to each day in a year.&nbsp;Then we could say,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;"53rd day of the year".&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Write a program that reads a year and the&nbsp;order number of a day, and checks if this&nbsp;day is the first day of a month or not.</p> 
  <p>The program must output either&nbsp;"<strong>true"</strong> or "<strong>false"</strong>.</p>
